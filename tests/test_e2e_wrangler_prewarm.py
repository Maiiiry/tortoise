"""The e2e `Pre-warm wrangler toolchain` steps stay pinned AND retry-protected.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
On 2026-10-15 the required `legal-e2e` check went red before it ran a single
assertion: the pre-warm step's first `npx --yes wrangler@4 --version` died with

    npm error network Invalid response body while trying to fetch
    https://registry.npmjs.org/wrangler: read ECONNRESET

a transient npm-registry reset on a cold runner. The step had no retry, so the
flakiest part of the job — a network fetch — was also its least protected, and
the retry that DOES exist lives in the boot loop below, which the failed
pre-warm never reached. A cold-runner fetch is exactly the thing a bounded retry
is for, so the step now retries (3 attempts, best-effort: the boot loop is the
real gate and surfaces wrangler's own log).

The pre-warm also floated `wrangler@4` while every boot step pins `4.127.0`, so
it warmed a DIFFERENT tarball than the one the boot actually fetched — the
agent-infra#414 drift class, and it also made npm download the whole packument
to resolve the range. The two versions must agree.

WHAT THIS PINS (a gate is worth what its wiring is worth — the #4311 convention)
  * every `Pre-warm wrangler toolchain` step pins an EXACT version
    (`wrangler@X.Y.Z`), never a floating `wrangler@4`;
  * the pinned version matches the version the SAME job's boot step starts, so
    the warm-up warms the tarball that runs;
  * the step is bounded-retry-protected (`for attempt in 1 2 3`);
  * the three e2e jobs that serve `website/` still HAVE the step — deleting it
    would silently push the cold fetch back onto the boot budget that #2178
    added it to protect.

This is parsed YAML, not a raw-text scan: the step's `run` string is read from
the loaded document, so a commented-out or renamed step cannot satisfy it.
